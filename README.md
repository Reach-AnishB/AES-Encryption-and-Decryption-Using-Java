# AES-Encryption-and-Decryption-Using-Java
This project demonstrates the implementation of AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption and decryption using Java. The implementation consists of three steps- key generation, encryption and decryption. Uses Java's Cryptography Architecture(JCA) to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts of cryptography and hands-on-implementation
